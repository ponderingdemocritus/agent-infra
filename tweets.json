Long post.\n\nMay has been very, very busy, which is great.\n\nAfter dropping my infographics for @playcambria and @playgigaverse, my DMs exploded.\nMassive thanks to BEN and Dith for the support.\n\nA bunch of projects reached out to work with me,  which means one thing:\n\n 👉People are watching\n\nEven eyes I didn’t know that existed 👀\n\nSome offered to pay me (for the first time ever!), from $50/infographic (lol, no, sorry not sorry) to more decent rates (still not quite fair for the HUGE amount of work an infographic takes), but a start. Because yes, everyone wants the best infographic for their project, but they struggle to put their money where their mouth is.\n\nEven though 99.9% of my work is free (sometimes I get gifted after, sometimes not), it still feels good to 1) get noticed and 2) to know your worth and say NO to offers that don’t respect it. \n\nBesides accepting a few of those collabs, I’ve also:\n\n- Hit 3K followers. WOW still can’t believe it. Thank you\n- Relaunched my YouTube channel & opened a 🇪🇸 one\n- Applied for a grant (fingers crossed)\n- Been trading + riding the @AbstractChain hype.

  "State of fableborne\n\nIn a past few weeks I have seen a huge amount of fud regarding fableborne on twitter and discord.\n\nA lot of people think that the game is dead and last anouncment in their discord was too vague and it didnt explain much.\n\nSo as a community member and the best player I want to answer all the question regarding season 4, tge and more from my perspective.\n\nFirstly I will mention that 98% of team decisions were right, to this day I am unhappy only about one little thing but it will probably be resolved later.\n\nSo where does the fud comes from? The main reason why people think that game is dead is because the last season ended in december, and its been almost 5 months since then. We did have a playtest and a staking test but many people werent a part of them/they simply dont care\n\nTo answer all the questions simply, team is most probably waiting for better market condition. Now they havent said anything about tge officially but I see no other reason for them to postpone season 4 which is already fully finsihed and ready to release any day.\n\nKam, the founder has said many times that its important that the game recieves tier 1 cex listing, the onchain resources have already been added to the website and the staking programm is fully ready.\n\nYou have to understand that season 4 will have kingdom integration and they cannot be used without power which even further proves my points.\n\nThe team didnt make any promises regarding any dates\n\nThis is where most of the projects fuck up, they give unrealistic dates and then they fail to deliver which breaks trust.\n\nSo we have nothing else to do but wait, we already tested the season 4 build, we have tested the staking and there isnt much more to keep people entertained.\n\nTbh it shouldnt be the problem in the long term but knowing how fast crypto moves i see where the fud comes from and I honestly dk what more can the team do as they are in the stale mate rn. \n\nHopefully this post will answer all the \"fableborne is dead\" questions",
