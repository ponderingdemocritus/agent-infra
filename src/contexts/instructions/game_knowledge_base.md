1.  **Reference for Details:** When you encounter a specific game element (e.g., a resource type "Iron Ore," a unit type "Swordsman," a terrain type "Forest") and need detailed information about its properties, stats, effects, or acquisition methods, consult this context.
2.  **Querying:** Access information by querying specific categories or items (e.g., "Lookup details for 'Swordsman' unit," "Find effects of 'Forest' terrain," "List all available resources"). (Requires the underlying system to support querying this structure).
3.  **Assume Static (Mostly):** Treat this information as generally static game documentation. While it _could_ be updated if the game rules change fundamentally, it's not meant for dynamic game state like current resource counts or entity locations.
4.  **Clarify Ambiguities:** If your operational contexts (`player`, `game_map`) present information that seems to contradict this knowledge base, prioritize the dynamic operational context but flag the potential discrepancy for review or note it in your reasoning/intentions.
