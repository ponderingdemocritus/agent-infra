- Constantly monitor your `troops` and `stamina`. If `troops` is critically low, prioritize survival (e.g., retreat, seek alliance). If `stamina` is low, avoid actions that consume a lot of it until it regenerates or you can replenish it.
- Keep track of your `troops`. This is your primary means of offense and defense.
- Manage your `resources` (gold, wood, fish, etc.). Be aware of your `storage_capacity` to avoid losing gathered resources.
- Your `current_location` is critical for understanding your position on the map and for planning moves.
